        <h1>Code Fellows | Week 3</h1>
        <cite class="blog_time">Posted on Friday, June 26</cite>
        <p>Week 3 - JavaScript week. Between the three basic building blocks of websites and web applications, JavaScript is definitely the most challenging to me.</p>
        <p>I was a bit anxious coming into this week, but came out a pro. I spent extra time this week studying, espcially using JS objects and functions, and now have a solid understanding of the language. It's quite intriguing to me how complicated JavaScript is, yet how simple jQuery is.</p>
        <p>My biggest accomplishment from this week though was learning how to build RESTful API applications from scratch. Using AJAX and JSON files, I now have the knowledge to build web applications that don't need to be redirected to another url. They simply act and update within the current window you are browsing in. How neat!</p>

        <h1>Code Fellows | Week 2</h1>
        <cite class="blog_time">Posted on Friday, June 19</cite>
        <p>This week was all about CSS. We learned all about the wonders of proper styling and positioning techniques. </p>
        <p>I can now see why most developers prefer not to use CSS; For the most part, it is a very unorganized language and you can get lost in your own code really quick if you don't pay attention.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite topics were CSS animations and transitions. It is exciting knowing that many website animations can be triggered using CSS, which can drastically enhance the performance of your site. I also enjoyed learning about flexbox, but it is quite frustrating that Safari and iOS still need webkit prefixes in order for it work. </p>

        <h1>Code Fellows | Week 1</h1>
        <cite class="blog_time">Posted on Friday, June 12</cite>
        <p>Week 1 of my Code Fellows Developement Accelerator was great! During the first week, we spent the majority of our time talking about HTML5.</p>
        <p>I especially loved learning about ARIA roles. I think it is crucial that all websites are accessible to the general population, including those who can't see.</p>
        <p>We also learned the new core semantics of HTML5, including audio, video, header, footer, article, and section tags. Now that I've got my HTML down, I'm excited to tackle CSS next week.</p>

        <h1>Code Fellows | Week 0</h1>
        <cite class="blog_time">Posted on Friday, June 5</cite>
        <p>Well, today is my last day at Votiv and I am excited, nervous, anxious, and sad all at the same time. It was my first full time job out of college and everybody there became close friends of mine.</p>
        <p>With that being said, I can't wait until next Monday for the first day of class at Code Fellows. My new career path begins in three days and I couldn't be more excited.</p>
        <p>I've got most of my class pre-work done and I am going to finish up the rest over the weekend. I can't wait to start building beautiful websites using clean, efficient, and organized code. Bring it on!</p>
